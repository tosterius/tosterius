- gradient boosting is an ensembling technique that gradually moves an approximate model to
a good model, by adding _weak models_ to composite model
- boosting itself does not specify how to choose the weak models, but in practice almost always Decision Trees are used
- GB adds one weak model at a time
- each next weak model is designed to reconstruct the residual
